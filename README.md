## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on the automated detection of leukemia cells in cervical pap smear images using a blend of traditional computer vision techniques and deep learning models. It presents a comparative analysis of multiple preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification approaches to assess their impact on detection accuracy.

## 🧪 Dataset
**Dataset Used:** [Sipakmed](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed)

Contains high-resolution images of single-cell pap smear slides used for classification.

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Techniques
- **Otsu's Thresholding**
- **Watershed Segmentation**

These strategies were tested to evaluate their effect on downstream classification performance.

## 🔍 Feature Extraction Methods
Five traditional feature extraction techniques were employed:

- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**
- **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)**
- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**
- **Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)**
- **Gabor Filters**

## 🤖 Classification Models
Extracted features were fed into the following machine learning models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## 🧠 Deep Learning Models
To compare with traditional techniques, raw images were also classified using:

- **AlexNet**
- **VGG19**
- **ResNet**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrices**

All models were evaluated based on the metrics above to highlight performance strengths and weaknesses.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Preprocessing significantly influences classification performance.
- Traditional feature extraction techniques still offer competitive accuracy.
- Deep learning models outperform in terms of generalization but require more data and compute.
